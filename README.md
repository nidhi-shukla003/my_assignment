A lightweight yet powerful routing system.
An advanced dependency injection container.
Multiple storage solutions for session handling and caching.
An intuitive and expressive ORM for database interactions.
Database migrations that work across different database systems.
Efficient background task processing.
Real-time event broadcasting.
Laravel is well-suited for building robust and scalable applications with ease.
